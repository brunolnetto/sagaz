## Key Concepts

### The Saga Pattern

A Saga is a sequence of local transactions where each step has a compensating action. If any step fails, the saga executes compensations in reverse order.

```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → ... → Complete
   ↓        ↓        ↓
Comp 1 ← Comp 2 ← Comp 3 ← ... ← Failure
```

### Transactional Outbox

Ensures exactly-once event delivery by storing events in the database within the same transaction as business data, then publishing asynchronously.

```
[Business Logic] → [DB Transaction] → [Outbox Table] → [Worker] → [Broker]
```

## Performance

| Metric | Local (kind) | Production Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Insert Rate | 1,800/sec | 10,000+/sec |
| Process Rate | 1,265/sec | 5,000+/sec |
| Latency (p99) | <100ms | <50ms |
